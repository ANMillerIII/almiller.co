## Climate Journey

## Climate Journey

The “climate journey” is an exhilarating concept which acknowledges that an understanding and appreciation of our shared environmental crisis is not inherited but rather evolves through dedicated dialog, study, and reflection. My own climate journey began with Aldo Leopold’s “Sand County Almanac” and its conception of the “land ethic,” which emphasizes humility as integral to restoring ecological balance. Or, more simply, it was borne in gratitude for carefree childhood summers spent exploring the New England woods à la “Calvin and Hobbes.”

These beginnings of an ecological conscience were sown throughout my time as a farmer at Spring Valley Farm in Connecticut, where I was fortunate to spend a year growing with a community rich in diversity of lived experience and united in our ecological citizenship. Moreover, these principles were brought into highest relief during my journeys along the lengths of the Appalachian and Pacific Crest Trails. Living beneath the forest’s shade for seasons at a time is a poignant call to action for their preservation, particularly in light of the ever-increasing impacts of wildfires and anthropogenic climate change.
