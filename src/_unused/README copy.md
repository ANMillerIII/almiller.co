### Software Engineer

### Computer science, philosophy, environmentalism


I am a software engineer passionate about sustainability, working at a consulting firm in the energy sector based in Washington D.C. Our team supports our client's initiatives towards a more sustainable energy future.

My primary interests are at the intersection of sustainability, philosophy, and technology. To that end, I have been building contours.co, a streamlined satellite image pre-processing API for computer vision requests in OpenCV with React and AWS to simplify LiDAR data processing at scale.

Outside of creating I enjoy being out on trail, learning piano works by Maurice Ravel, and spending time with my girlfriend Perrin. Communities that I am interested/involved in include Work on Climate and Less Wrong.
