<h2 id="about_header">Welcome</h2>
<div class="about">
<p>
My name is Al and it's good to meet you. I am a software engineer with interests spanning philosophy, sustainability and technology.
</p>
<p>
Outside of working on teams <a href="https://www.malott.co/posts/more-software-engineering-principles.html#grow"><span><i>growing</i><span></a> software, I enjoy being out on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ai6nz2hmtW8" target="__blank"><span><i>trail</i></span></a>, learning piano works by my favorite composer Maurice Ravel, and spending time with my girlfriend Perrin. Communities that I am interested/involved in include <a href="https://workonclimate.org/" target="__blank"><span><i>Work on Climate</i></span></a> and <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com" target="__blank"><span><i>Less Wrong</i></span></a>.
</p>
<p>
These pieces are written primarily to organize my own thoughts, though naturally I would be lying if I said that I did not want others to read and hopefully find value in them.
</p>
<p>
Please feel free to reach out.
