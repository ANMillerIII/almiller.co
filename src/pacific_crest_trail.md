### An Opportunity

In 2018, I had the privileged opportunity to spend a summer <i>en plein air</i>, hiking the length of the Pacific Crest Trail.

Much has been written by the thousands who have completed this ~2,700 mile journey, to which I have included references to at the end.

Herein is an abstract of my experience and excerpts from the constellation of thoughts preceding and surronding it. If you would like a more exhaustive account, or would like to discuss your own PCT experience, I would (genuinely) love to hear from you, and encourage you to reach out directly.

### Before the West

Prior to the Pacific Crest Trail, there was the Appalachian Trail. Being from Connecticut I think of it that way, though both were inagurated concurrently in 1956 with the National Trail Act.

I did not choose to hike the Pacific Crest Trail; it was an inevitability, the natural segue, following my hike of the 2,200 mile Appalachian Trail in 2017.

Deciding to hike was arguably a conmensurate journey to the thing itself. In my junior year at the University of Connecticut, I felt strong pressure to embrace the career track and find a summer internship.

Those plans were laid to rest in stumbling upon the video logs of John Zahorian, a noteworthy figure in the (what I learned to be) vibrant thruhiking community. The natural beauty and nomadic ethos embodied in John's videos opened my perception to what I considered possible in terms of taking agency over ones choices, and choosing such an adventure as this.

### Practicalities

Whenever backpacking comes up in conversation, I am more often than not asked 

quote what did you carry?" 

I really enjoy this question, because it strikes at the heart of why many people backpack. This question is really saying, 

"what does it take to be self-sufficient, and secondly, could I do it?"

For a full list of what I carried, please see ___.

### Beginning

From San Diego to the Mexican border and from the border to Canada. 700 miles desert hiking.

I remeber the first night out of Campo underestimating water and being thirsty, then waking up the following morning to frost over my sleeping bag on the ground.

The motiviations for hiking are simple to articulate. The physical and mental benefits of constant physical exertion, the awe of nature, and the diversity of days leave little question in answering "why". However. Taking an absence of months from work, not having ties requiring attention through the duration - these attributes ensure that thru-hiking, and extended travel in general - are a privileged activity.

### Oregon

### Wildfires

Looking back on the orange-smoke permated photos brings back memories of the raspy breath and pained eyes. It is a wonder that I did not preserve my lungs a bit (air quality index at the time worked out to 2 packs of cigarettes a day).

Also the complacency of tenting down in a place where wildfires flames were visible.

### Reflecting

There are 60 miles in Glacier that I have yet to traverse. I am excited by the propsect of potentially doing this in 2021 with Perrin. From Rainy Pass to Manning Park. I am nearly grateful that it did not work out last time, so that I have an excuse to return. And this time with someone else.
