                &emsp; The best things in life involve building meaningful relationships with people and
                spending as much time as possible in and appreciating nature.A year of my time was spent with a
                remarkable
                community at Spring Valley Farm in Connecticut, and I have also had the privilege to dedicate two
                summers to
                completing the Appalachian and Pacific Crest Trails.

                problems. Feel free to check out my

                I try to approach each day with the optimism which it deserves, and am grateful for the many
                oppurtunities I
                have had and those which await to do my part to better the world in small steps.
