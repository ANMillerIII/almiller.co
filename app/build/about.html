        <p>
            As there are countless ideas competing for my attention at any given time, I thought it wise to jot some of
            them down here (primarily for my own organizational benefit - if they interest you, all the better)!
        </p>
        <p>
            I started out in Mystic, Connecticut (of sailing fame) in 1996 and have made my way down to Washington D.C.
            for cherry blossoms (and work). I am deeply passionate about doing my part to create a more holistically
            sustainable world - starting with social sustainability. To this end, I am leading the creation of a project
            to one day eliminate the stigma against vocational (so-called "blue-collar") work, and begin bridging the
            human-connectedness gap between the working class and "urban-elite", which of late has come into high-relief
            on the political stage. </p>
        <p>
            As for myself, the best things in life revolve around building meaningful relationships with people,
            spending as much time as possible in and appreciating nature, and leveraging my boundless technical
            curiosity to solve meaningful problems. I spend too much time thinking and not enough time working with my
            hands, so trying to do a bit more of that as well. I believe that in life for all things there is a season, and my lived experience has epitomized this
            philosophy. From spending a year farming and studying at the communal Spring Valley Farm (University of
            Connecticut) to hiking 5,000 miles alone on the Appalachian (2017) and Pacific Crest (2018) Trails, to
            dedicatedly practicing classical piano through college to working on very exciting technical and people
            problems across a wide-array of disciplines in a consulting role near the city - I would say that I have
            been fortunate enough to have had a good run of it so far.
        </p>
        <p>
            I try to approach each day with the optimism which it deserves, and am grateful for the many oppurtunities I
            have had and those which await to do my part to better the world in small steps.
